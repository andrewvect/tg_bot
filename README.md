# Serbian Vocabulary Learning Telegram Bot

A modern vocabulary learning application that combines a Telegram bot with an embedded web application designed to help users efficiently learn new words and expand their vocabulary in Serbian language. The app utilizes a **spaced repetition algorithm (SRS)** to optimize the learning process and improve long-term retention of vocabulary.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Spaced Repetition Learning**: Uses scientifically proven SRS algorithm for optimal memory retention
- 📚 **3700+ Serbian Words**: Vocabulary list based on frequency data from Wiktionary Serbian word list
- 🎨 **Interactive Web App**: Modern React-based interface embedded in Telegram
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your learning progress with detailed statistics
- ⚙️ **Customizable Settings**: Choose alphabet preferences (Cyrillic, Latin, or both)
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support**: Serbian words with translations and usage examples
- 🔄 **Adaptive Learning**: Algorithm adjusts based on your performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

For the fastest setup, use our automated script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewvect/tg_bot.git
cd tg_bot
./scripts/quick-setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Check prerequisites
- Set up environment variables
- Clone and configure bot polling
- Build and start all services
- Guide you through bot token configuration

### Option 2: Manual Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for easy setup)
- **Python 3.8+** and **Node.js 18+** (for local development)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewvect/tg_bot.git
cd tg_bot
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # if available, or create from template below
```

Essential variables to configure:

```env
# Telegram Bot Configuration
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_TESTING=true  # Set to false for production

# Domain Configuration
DOMAIN=localhost.tiangolo.com  # For local development
ENVIRONMENT=local

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Bot Content Source
URL_TO_GIT_FILES=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewvect/words/refs/heads/main/
```

### 3. Get Your Bot Token

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Create a new bot with `/newbot`
3. Copy the bot token and add it to your `.env` file
4. Set up bot commands (optional):
   ```
   start - Start learning vocabulary
   help - Get help and usage instructions
   ```

### 4. Set Up Bot Polling (Required)

The bot requires a separate polling service. Clone and set it up:

```bash
# In a separate directory
git clone https://github.com/andrewvect/bot_polling
cd bot_polling

# Build and run the polling container
docker build -t bot_polling_image .
docker run -d --name bot_polling \
    -v $(pwd)/../tg_bot/.env:/app/.env \
    bot_polling_image
```

### 5. Start the Application

```bash
# In the main tg_bot directory
docker compose watch
```

This will start:
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on port 5432
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8080 (Adminer)

### 6. Test Your Bot

1. Open Telegram and find your bot
2. Send `/start` to begin
3. Click "Открыть приложение" to access the web interface
4. Start learning vocabulary!

## 📖 How It Works

### Learning Process

1. **Word Discovery**: Choose whether you know a word when presented
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Words you're learning appear at calculated intervals
3. **Active Recall**: Try to remember the translation before revealing it
4. **Performance Tracking**: Mark if you remembered correctly or not
5. **Adaptive Scheduling**: Successfully recalled words appear less frequently

### Bot Commands

Once your bot is set up, users can interact with it using these commands:

- `/start` - Start learning vocabulary and see the main menu
- `/help` - Get detailed help and usage instructions

### Bot Features

**Main Menu Options:**
- 🔤 **Add New Words** - Learn new vocabulary from the 3700+ word database
- 🔄 **Review Words** - Practice words you've already started learning
- ⚙️ **Settings** - Customize your learning experience

**Learning Interface:**
- 👁️ **Spoiler Button** - Reveal translation and usage examples
- ✅ **Success Button** - Mark when you remembered correctly
- ❌ **Difficulty Button** - Mark when you had trouble remembering
- 📊 **Progress Tracking** - See how many words you've learned

**Customization Options:**
- **Alphabet Choice**: Learn with Cyrillic, Latin, or both scripts
- **Display Language**: Choose which language appears first
- **Random Mode**: Mix up word order for variety

### Language Levels

The vocabulary is organized by frequency and complexity:

- 🔸 **A1 — 500 words** (Basic phrases and daily communication)
- 🔸 **A2 — 1000 words** (Extended topics and travel)
- 🔸 **B1 — 2000 words** (Familiar topics, news comprehension)
- 🔸 **B2 — 3000 words** (Confident language use, dialogue)
- 🔸 **C1+ — 4000+ words** (Fluent speech, literature, complex topics)

- Wait for database to be ready (first startup takes longer)

**Frontend not loading:**
- Check if all services are running: `docker compose ps`
- Verify `DOMAIN` configuration in `.env`
- Clear browser cache and try again

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure Docker has proper permissions
- Check file ownership: `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .`

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Setup Questions

**Q: Do I need to know Serbian to use this bot?**
A: No! The bot is designed to teach Serbian vocabulary to speakers of other languages. All interface text and instructions are provided in the user's language.

**Q: Why do I need a separate bot polling service?**
A: The bot polling service handles Telegram message reception during development. In production, the main application uses webhooks instead.

**Q: Can I use this bot to learn other languages?**
A: The current version is specifically designed for Serbian vocabulary, but the architecture could be adapted for other languages by changing the word database and content files.

**Q: How many words can I learn?**
A: The bot includes 3700+ Serbian words organized by frequency of use, covering vocabulary from beginner (A1) to advanced (C1+) levels.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the difference between Cyrillic and Latin alphabets?**
A: Serbian can be written in both Cyrillic (Ћирилица) and Latin (Latinica) scripts. The bot allows you to learn with either or both alphabets.

**Q: How does the spaced repetition algorithm work?**
A: Words you answer correctly appear less frequently, while words you find difficult appear more often. This optimizes your learning time and improves retention.

**Q: Can I backup my learning progress?**
A: Your progress is stored in the PostgreSQL database. You can backup the database or export your data through the admin interface.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: The bot only stores your Telegram ID, learning progress, and settings. No personal information is collected beyond what's necessary for the learning algorithm.

### Usage Questions

**Q: How often should I use the bot?**
A: The spaced repetition algorithm works best with regular, short sessions. Even 10-15 minutes daily is more effective than occasional long sessions.

**Q: What if I make a mistake marking a word as known/unknown?**
A: Don't worry! The algorithm will adjust over time based on your continued performance with that word.

**Q: Can I reset my progress and start over?**
A: Yes, you can reset your progress through the settings or by contacting an admin to clear your data.
